Analyzing weather data with Pytohn, SQLite, and Flask.

## Resources 
- Python 3.7.6, JupyterLab 2.26, VS Code 1.51.1
- SQLAlchemy ORM 1.3.19(https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/), Python Database Abstraction Library.
- hawaii.sqlite: database file where temperature data is stored.

## Overview
The purspose of this project is to analyze weather data  for a stakeholder interested in investing in a surfing business located in Hawaii.
This data ha been collected by a Weather Observing System and stored in a flat database file(.db/.sqlite).

To ensure business is sustainable, year-round weather trends needs to be analyzed. 

In order to gain an understanding of hawaiis weather the stakeholder has expressed explicit interest in weather statistics for the months of June and December. 

## Results 
To access the observation data and analyze it, I have utilized SQLaclhemy ORM, which allows me to query the data by passing python objects as queries.
